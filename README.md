# Fifteen Puzzle

A web implementation of the "Fifteen Puzzle" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle ) I did for no particular reason one day.

Demo: http://dreamer.dreamwing.com/fifteen/

Building:

Just run tsc in the root directory to compile the typescript and it's good to go.

Issues:

- Doesn't scale to fit some mobile devices properly
- Doesn't support retina resolutions
